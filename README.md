## Running

This is a project built on [impactjs](http://impactjs.com/) a paid library,
and as such the code here is only part of what you will need to get the game running.
You will need to get the impact source merged in to be able to run it.

You are more than welcome to use it in any way you see fit, however make sure you follow whatever licenses impact has when you choose to merge the two projects together.
